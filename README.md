### Optimization of advertising campaigns using audience clustering in performance marketing

#### Motivation
Audience clustering allows for segmenting users based on their behavioral factors, preferences, and interactions with advertising creatives and the marketing funnel. The results of this approach enable marketers to develop advertising campaigns that meet the specific needs of different user clusters instead of relying on generic demographic factors and filters. Overall, clustering enables better audience understanding and allows for more effective targeting of advertising campaigns. As a result, this leads to minimizing advertising costs and higher market profits for the enterprise.

#### Methodology
##### K-means clustering
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm for partitioning data into clusters or groups based on similarities. It groups data points such that the points in the same group (or cluster) are more similar than those in other clusters.

##### Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
Agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up approach. It starts with each data point as its cluster and then progressively merges clusters until only one cluster remains or until a stopping criterion is met.

##### Spectral Hierarchical Clustering
Spectral Hierarchical Clustering is a hybrid clustering technique that combines the principles of spectral clustering with hierarchical clustering. It takes advantage of the properties of the data's graph or similarity matrix and then applies hierarchical clustering to the graph-based data to form clusters.
